# MiniTalk

## üß† About  

The **Minitalk** project implements a simple communication protocol between two processes using **UNIX signals**.  

The communication occurs over a single ‚Äúvirtual wire‚Äù created by signal transmission:  
- The **speaker (client)** sends a message by transmitting a sequence of signals.  
- The **listener (server)** receives and interprets these signals to reconstruct the original message.  

The project‚Äôs main goal is to understand **low-level interprocess communication (IPC)** and synchronization using only `SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2`.

## üìú Mandatory Requirements  

- Create two executables: `server` and `client`.  
- The **client** must send a string as a message to the **server**, identified by its process ID (PID).  
- The **server** displays the received message on the standard output.  
- Use **only** `SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2`.

---

## üíé Bonus Features  

- Implement an acknowledgment system so the client knows the message was received.  
- Support **Unicode characters** for extended text compatibility.
